## The Copy
I studied economics especially international finance in my university. My graduation thesis was about the effect on car industries by replacement from gasoline-powered vehicle to electric vehicle. Through this analysis I found out the importance of opened innovation between other kinds of industries. Now I am interested in VR technology and keep studying because it has potential to connect lots of people beyond physical distance.

## What I want to do in the future
I would like to contribute to the development of technology and working style. I believe the development of technology will be promoted by opened innovation. My goal is to connect lots of engineer and give more opportunity to meet person they haven`t met. My major was economics but not VR technology is my most interest. I assume VR can overcome physical distance and enable unexpected encounter. I experienced VR internship for 3 months in Australia and looking for other opportunity in VR industry.

About my work experience
It was tech company serving VR experience especially for real estate. We provided VR housing drawn from working drawing and served experience as customers really live before construction get started. I mainly used Unity software and made visual, texture better to make it looked beautiful. I haven`t experienced such a VR development but I was filled with passion and asked lots of things for other engineers.

Difficulties I faced
The difficulties I faced was miscommunication because of language. When we develop software adequate communication is required. There are lots of specific English words and they made it difficult to do that. What I kept in my mind was not to be reluctant to ask something. I asked lots of questions without any hesitation. I tried to have communication spontaneously. As a result we could have better communication and cooperated with each other.

What I learned
What I leaned was the importance to communicate spontaneously. I worked with people who used different language and had different culture. Without enough communication we could not work well. If I waited that they talked to me I thought I could not go well with them. That way I kept it in my mind to talk spontaneously and tried to build a trust.
